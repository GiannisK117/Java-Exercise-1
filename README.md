By developing this Java program, I have gained practical experience in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the management of data structures. I learned how to define classes like Ball and Box, utilizing encapsulation through private fields, constructors, and getter/setter methods to control data access. I mastered the use of the ArrayList class and the List interface to store and organize objects dynamically. Furthermore, I practiced various techniques for manipulating collections, such as using an Iterator for safe element removal, implementing lambda expressions with removeIf for efficient filtering, and using enhanced for-loops for traversing lists and calculating aggregate values like total weight. Finally, I improved my understanding of class relationships, specifically composition, by creating a Box class that contains and manages a collection of Ball objects.
